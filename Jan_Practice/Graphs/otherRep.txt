Adj matrix 

0 0 1 0     verices row * col = 4 * 4
0 1 0 1     the connected are represented as 1  and not connected as 0
0 0 1 1     for weighted graph the 1 is replaces with the weight
1 0 0 1     

EdgeList

Edges = {{0,2},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3}};
mainly used in min spanning tree

Implicit graph 
works like 2 D array

Minimum spanning tree(MST)
a minimum spanning tree(MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the  edgesof a connected,
edge weighted undirected graph that connects  all the vertices together, without any cycles and with 
the minimum possible total edge weights.

Strongly Connected Component
SCC is a component in which we can reach every vertex of the component from every other vertex 
in that component.
